## Reflection: STAR Technique

### Situation
As part of our work readiness program earlier this year, I participated in an innovative self-directed mock interview designed to simulate the pressure and structure of real job interviews in the ICT industry. Facing the unique challenge of creating authentic interview conditions independently, I developed a comprehensive simulation where technical and behavioral questions appeared as visual prompts, which I would read aloud before immediately recording my responses. This format created genuine pressure to think on my feet, as I encountered each question in real-time without pre-rehearsed answers, mirroring the unpredictability of actual technical interviews.

### Task
My objective was to create and execute a professional-grade interview simulation that would test my technical knowledge, communication skills, and composure under pressure. I needed to design challenging questions comparable to those used by tech employers, then demonstrate my ability to process unfamiliar problems quickly, articulate structured responses, and maintain professional presence despite the unusual format of being both questioner and respondent. The challenge required balancing immediate comprehension of visual prompts with delivering coherent, substantive answers while managing the technical aspects of recording and self-assessment.
I needed to articulate my strengths, address my development areas constructively, and make a compelling case for my candidacy while handling questions and maintaining composure throughout the process.Specific goals included: clearly explaining complex technical concepts from my portfolio, demonstrating problem-solving methodology for coding challenges, showcasing soft skills through behavioral scenarios, maintaining positive body language and vocal tone under pressure, and ultimately presenting myself as a well-rounded candidate worthy of advancement to the next hiring stage.

### Action
I began by developing a comprehensive question bank covering technical fundamentals, behavioral scenarios, and problem-solving exercises relevant to entry-level ICT positions. For the simulation itself, I established a structured process: when each question appeared on screen, I read it aloud to create auditory reinforcement and simulate actual interview conditions, then immediately began recording my response. This approach eliminated rehearsal time and forced authentic, spontaneous answers. I maintained professional dress and setting throughout, and between questions, I quickly noted initial self-assessments regarding response clarity, technical accuracy, and areas needing improvement. The entire process required intense focus as I constantly switched between reading, processing, responding, and self-evaluating.

### Result
The mock interview provided invaluable practical experience and specific feedback that highlighted my strong technical foundation and project knowledge, while identifying key areas for improvement in my interview technique. This self-directed mock interview produced unexpectedly valuable outcomes. The format revealed my natural response patterns and highlighted specific areas where I struggled with immediate problem articulation. By reviewing the recordings, I identified several technical concepts that needed deeper understanding and noticed communication habits (such as filler words and rushed explanations) that required refinement. The experience dramatically improved my ability to think under pressure and organize my thoughts quickly. Most importantly, it demonstrated my proactive approach to professional development and ability to create effective learning opportunities independently - a valuable skill in the rapidly evolving ICT industry where self-directed learning is essential for career growth. This experience directly boosted my confidence for real interviews and provided me with actionable insights to refine my interview strategy, particularly in tailoring my communication style to different audience types and strengthening my overall presentation as a candidate. Most importantly, it transformed my understanding of interviews from being interrogations to opportunities for genuine professional dialogue, a mindset shift that has fundamentally improved my approach to professional communication and self-presentation in high-stakes situations.
